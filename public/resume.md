## ABOUT ME

I am a **full-stack dev** with experience across a wide range of technologies and industries, and a passion for **learning
new things** and **making new connections**. I have worked in organizations from 10 to 10,000, on teams of 3 to 13+, and one
attribute I'm often credited with and proud of, is being a **great team player**.

I am an experienced people leader, but my real love is **writing code** and **seeing it work**. I believe in **unit and automated
testing**, but I'm not a TDD zealot. My **Git history** is clean and well-commented, and I appreciate a really well-crafted
**Pull Request** or **Issue Description** as much as a detailed **Readme file**. Updating **documentation** is something I have
incorporated into my development cycle, and I have thanked myself many times for **_just writing it down_**.

I love **solving new problems** and **fixing whatâ€™s broken**.
